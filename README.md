# JavaScript-Project

NoName is an interactive data visualization web app that allows users to view an element's atom model. Each element can be selected on the interactive periodic table on the left. When the element is selected, the model of the respective element will be shown on the right along with its description. The goal of this project is to allow users to have a better visualization of electrons orbiting the nucleus.


## Functionality & MVPs
With NoName, users will be able to:
* Click on the cells of the periodic table

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs
* Vanilla Javascript: for handling buttons, toggles
* Canvas API: to render the models 
* Webpack: to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
